A rework of the terribly coded firmware from the BTT S42B v2 boards

I am currently working on redoing a lot of the functions found in the firmware. A list of the current things that are being worked on is in the Projects tab. If you don't see your issue there, then please let me know.

New Features:

Future Features:
  - Redone stepping setup
  - Redone serial commands (based on gcode)
  - Manual tuning utility for manual tuning
  - Much better stepper calibration
  - New menu items for setting PID parameters
